        <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>     Ghost Of Tsushima is a open world action rpg not to disssimilar to the Assassin's creed francise.
            Created by Sucker Punch Productions, published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, and released on
            July 17 2020. It is one my favorite ps4 games if not one of my favorite games in general. </p>
        
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>     Argueably one of Ghost of Tsushima's weaknesses is it's gameplay.
                It's not bad by any stretch but it is sadly rather on the generic side while it certianly has some 
                elements that are unique but at it's core it's rather bog standard overall. The most unique elemtnt to the gameplay is the combat
                more specificly the stances. Each stance is made to be effective against against a certian enemy type,
                however you don't start out with them and you must defeat paticular enemies and/or study them to create the styles.
                the other unique game play element is challenging enemies where shoudl you approch them you challenge the to a draw off
                where you must counter and time it right you will be givine a free kill (or 3) on a very annoying enemy fail however and you will take a great deal of damage right out the gate
                Unfortuntely thats about where it ends in terms of unique mechanics however they do have a unique type of fight: duels.
                Duels are the highlight of combat where you and a single foe fight out in well a duel  most of these are essentally just the games version of a boss fight
                but the style and excution really imporve them to something great.

        <h3>Story/Charcters</h3>
            <p>
                The Story and Charcters are where the game really excel. Ghost takes place in 1274 durning the begining of the mongol
                invasion of Japan. After a disastrous attempt to stop at least hold off the mongols Jin Sakai (the main charcter) is one of the only surviors left.
                After his uncle the Lord of Tsushima is captured Jin must rescue him and stop the mongols before they reach the main land.
                While the overall conflict between Jin and the mongols is decent the real conflict and the far more intresting one is Jin and the idea of honor.
                Jin being a samurai and raised as one natrually takes honor as the most important thing in his life. However the mongols don't care about fighting honorably and even more so their leader Khotun Khan
                knows the how the samurai code of honor works and how it forces them to fight and act. Beacuse of this Jin now stuggles between using dishonorable
                but highly praticle tactics and following the code of honor that has followed and guided him his entire life.
                These two sides are repsented by Yuna a theif who saved Jin's life and encourges him to engage in more dececeptive and dishonorable ways of warfare
                (stealh, poison, fear tactics, assassination, etc) and Lord Shimura Jin's uncle and a dedicated samurai who tries to keep him on the honorable path
                despite it's flaws. The conflict between the Jin and Shimura is very intresting and while they clearly care for the other and Tsushima they are both equally resolute in how to procced.
                Niether is shown to be entirely incorrect but natrually the game favors Jin over his uncle but regadless you can still feel how much pain both of them are going through during the whole war.
                They are even show to be mirrors of the other but I want to try to avoid spoilers so i wont go into here but regadless the coflicts set up really drive the game to home beyond what could have been.

         <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Ghost of Tsushima is a great game and a beautful one as well while i would like more intresting or involved gameplay mechanics
                the Charcters and Story evolve it from what could have been just a boring and rather generic game set in a beautful landscape I hope for 
                more Ghost of Tsushima soon!
