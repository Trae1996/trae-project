            <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
                <p>Gameplay is fairly standard and there isn't much to talk about. However it's multiplayer is where it's strongest
                    to be more specific it's Operations mode. In Operations mode attackers try to capture flags and take control of section of the map while
                    defenders try to stop and eliminate all of attackers. It manages to make you fell like your in a movie. Tanks,Planes,Ships,and trains all used to try and defeat your enemies.
                    many a time have i felt like i was apart of some historic last stand or part of a grueling assault agisnt a foe who would not give up. This mode is takes full advantage of the games stengths and uses it to make
                    the best mode I have ever played in a game like this.

            <h3>Story</h3>
                <p>
                    Battlefield one is set durning the first world war your introduce to this with text saying how you are going to die and you begin play
                    as a charcter whose age and name you only hear about after they fall in battle. it creates a very power moment as strikes you just how quickly a life was just snuffed out.
                    It set the tone and the horrors of WW1 powerfully. Unfortuntely that is the strongest part of the game. Instead of a single story it the main campaign is a number of smaller stories that don't connect with one another.
                    While these stories have their moments the charcters and overall plots do not leave a lasting impression for very long at all.
                    Unfortuntely this hurts the games overall goal: to show the stories of and draw more intrest to ww1 and it's effects on the world. While I can't say it complely fails at this it doesn't do a great job either.

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <P>
                    Battlefield 1 is a very good game and while I wish it's story mode was stronger and more memorable I did enjoy it overall and the mulitplayer is top notch and fun even still.
