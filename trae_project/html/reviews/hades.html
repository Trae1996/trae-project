        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>
                    In Hades you must try to reach the the end all in one life. Everytime you die you must start from the beginning but lucklily you don't start with absolutely nothing.
                You are allowed to keep some resoucres to upgrade Zagreus over time making every run easier over time. Every escape attempt is also randomized with rooms and rewards.
                You arent entirely alone in your attempt as the greek gods offer you various (and randomized) boons to assist you during your escape attempt however you lose them as should you die.
                In addition you are given 6 weapons to that each have 4 diffrent forms together with the random boons given to you durning your runs can make every run feel wildly diffrent.

                <h3>Story/Characters</h3>
                <p>
                    The story is fairly basic Zagreus wants to leave hades his father Hades doesn't want him too beacuse no one is allowed to leave Hades so Zagreus must fight his way 
                    to the surface. What makes the game strong is it's characters everyone is intresting and likeable that you want to know more about them. From your father Hades to your pet Cerberus to the the Gorgon maid Dusa.
                    All of them are fun to talk to and this actually helps the game more. Dying and having to restart has alot of the edge taken off beacuse your still able to go talk to them and see what they have to say.
                    This includes the Gods on Olympus as well while you cant have a coversation with them they still will offer some commentary that make you want to go and talk to them as well.
